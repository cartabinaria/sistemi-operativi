/*
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
So we received the SIGSEGV signal from the operating system. This means that we tried to access an invalid memory address => printare indirizzi
di memoria delle variabili utilizzate del comando nel quale siamo sopra
In general, we can assume that library functions such as fgets work properly. So the problem must be one of our arguments.
The value of buf is 0x0, which is the NULL pointer.  buf should point to the memory we allocated on line 9. So we're going to have to find out what happened there.
=> settiamo un breakpoint a quella riga (9)
